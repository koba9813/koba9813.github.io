# We've renewed our website

Hello.
We have recently renewed our website.

Initially, we had a GitHub Pages site,
but we hadn't been actively updating it for a while and it was mostly neglected.
One of the triggers for this renewal was the desire to make it functional again.

In addition, the previous site had been around for a long time,
and I felt that the design and structure no longer suited me well.
I wanted to create a "form that I want to use now," including both the appearance and content,
so I decided to rebuild it.

## Renewal Highlights

In this update, we are focusing on the following points:

    Simplifying the overall design for better readability
    Adjusting the layout for easy reading on smartphones
    Changing the structure to facilitate future updates and additions

While some minor details are still being adjusted, I believe it is now easier to use than before.

## Moving Forward

On this site, in the future, we plan to post:

    Records of things I've made and tried
    Technical notes and memos
    Short thoughts and logs

I plan to post these occasionally and on a whim.
I will be updating it casually, so I would be happy if you could check in from time to time.
